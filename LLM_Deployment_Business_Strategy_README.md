## Execution Model

1. **LLM Stack Planning**  
   Choose core infrastructure (Fabric, Kore.ai, OpenAI) and hosting logic

2. **Use Case Prioritization**  
   Align LLM roadmap to highest-volume or highest-friction workflows

3. **Governance Parallelization**  
   Apply RACI, policy, risk matrix in parallel to model rollout

4. **Cross-Functional KPI Review**  
   Tie LLM performance to CX, Ops, and Finance dashboards

5. **Quarterly Tuning and Expansion**  
   Use logs + feedback to tune prompts and expand use cases
