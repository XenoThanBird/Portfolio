# LLM Training & Fine-Tuning Plan for Telecom IVR Modernization

This document outlines the plan to train and fine-tune a custom Large Language Model (LLM) to support Telecom’s high-volume IVR use cases. The model will be hosted within **Microsoft Fabric** and integrated via **Function Calling APIs** into the **Kore.ai XO Platform** to intelligently route and resolve 450M+ customer interactions annually.

## Objective

- Improve **intent recognition accuracy** to >92%
- Enable **task-level function calling** for core services (billing, repair, account, authentication)
- Deliver **context-aware, personalized responses**
- Reduce average handle time (AHT) and increase containment without compromising customer experience

## 1. Data Sourcing

### Sources Used:
| Data Type         | Description                                 | Source                |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Call Transcripts | Historical IVR call logs, annotated         | IVR Data Warehouse    |
| Knowledge Base | Billing, account, and repair FAQs           | Internal CMS          |
| CRM Records    | Account data, service plan metadata         | Salesforce            |
| Service Logs   | Past trouble tickets and issue resolutions  | Remedy                |
| SMEs           | Subject Matter Expert-provided utterance samples | Internal         |
| Feedback       | Customer reviews, surveys, escalation summaries | VOC Tools         |

### Data Volume:
- 25 TB across raw transcripts, labeled datasets, and metadata
- 150K+ labeled utterances across 12 service domains
- 300+ service endpoint function examples

## 2. Fine-Tuning Pipeline

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   Strip PII (account #, phone #, name); normalize utterance text; tokenize & embed for semantic alignment

2. **Intent Classification Training**  
   Base model: `GPT-J 6B` or `OpenAI GPT-4-turbo` (if accessible via API); loss function: cross-entropy on top-3 prediction; class balance via SMOTE-style oversampling

3. **Function Calling Schema Integration**  
   Map each dialog task to a `function_schema.json`; train the model to extract parameters using few-shot examples  
   Example: `check_bill_status(account_number, bill_month)`

4. **Multi-Turn Context Handling**  
   Annotate follow-up utterances for state retention; inject previous turns into prompt context

5. **Fine-Tuning Rounds**  
   Iteration 1: High-frequency intents (billing, payments, outages)  
   Iteration 2: Repair workflows (router, technician, diagnostics)  
   Iteration 3: Long-tail, escalation, and fallback detection

## 3. Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                        | Target      | Baseline   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Intent Accuracy               | >92%    | ~78%       |
| Parameter Extraction Accuracy | >95%    | ~70–80%    |
| F1 Score (Macro Avg)          | 0.91+   | 0.74       |
| Latency per Turn              | < 400ms | N/A        |
| Token Usage Reduction         | >20% savings | N/A   |
| Cost per Call Interaction     | ↓ $2.85–$3.10 | $4.75 |
| Call Containment Rate         | 65%     | 40–45%     |

---

## Continuous Improvement Loop

- Low Confidence Routing: Feedback loop triggers model retraining
- Active Learning: Annotate edge-case utterances flagged by fallback triggers
- Model Drift Detection: Monthly evaluation on new data
- Auto-Batch Refresh: Data from call logs continuously ingested into Fabric Lakehouse Bronze → Silver → Gold stages

---

## Security & Compliance

- PII Redaction Engine before training ingestion
- Azure Active Directory & RBAC for model access
- Audit trails via Fabric log analytics for governance reporting

---

## Dependencies

- Microsoft Fabric for data ingestion, model training, serving, and dashboards
- Kore.ai XO Platform for real-time interaction orchestration
- Power BI for performance tracking

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Finalize labeled utterance set
- [ ] Confirm function calling registry with Product Owners
- [ ] Initiate first fine-tuning batch in Fabric ML
- [ ] Connect performance dashboards to real-time analytics pipeline
