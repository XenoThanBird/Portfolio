# 🧠 Conversational AI Portfolio – Matthan Bird

Welcome to my Conversational AI Portfolio. This GitHub repository serves as a personal archive and professional showcase of my work in designing, developing, and optimizing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems and Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs).

## 📌 About Me

I'm Matthan Bird — an AI Business Analyst, Conversational Designer, and Data Strategist with a background in law, UX, and NLP engineering. I've led NLU training efforts, call flow migrations, and automation strategies for enterprise-grade IVR systems using platforms like **Kore.ai**, **Azure AI**, and **OpenAI Pro**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains two primary folders:

### 🗂️ `legacy_ui_designs/`
Outdated but valuable conversational IVR and CUI flowcharts, originally designed for high-volume enterprise telecom applications. These include:

- IVR Dialog Maps (Legacy Format)
- Persona-Based Voice UX Design Samples
- Intent Routing and Re-Prompt Flow Drafts
- Historical Use Case Documentation

> ⚠️ *Note: These designs may no longer reflect current branding, technical stacks, or LLM-integrated approaches — but remain illustrative of my journey through iterative CUI design.*

### 🧪 `nlu_team_templates/`
Reusable Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks developed during my time leading NLU model refinement and automation tasks, including:

- Cosine Similarity Clustering of User Utterances
- Intent-Mapping Boilerplates
- Few-Shot Intent Classifiers with Scikit-learn/Huggingface
- Interactive Dashboards for NLP Task Monitoring
- Entity Recognition Prep Scripts

> 🔍 These scripts emphasize practical workflows for NLP ops teams managing high-volume, multi-bot ecosystems without pretrained embeddings.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is intended to:

- Document reusable components of my AI workflow
- Showcase NLU/NLP ops design thinking
- Provide a conversation starter with other AI, data science, and conversational UX professionals
- Serve as an anchor portfolio for my LinkedIn profile

## 🚀 Getting Started

Most Python and Jupyter templates are plug-and-play. Just make sure to install the dependencies listed in the individual notebooks. Here's a general setup:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
