# LLM Deployment Best Practices (Enterprise-Grade)

This document outlines operational best practices for deploying large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o, Azure OpenAI, or Microsoft Fabric-hosted models in regulated, customer-facing environments.

## Deployment Checklist

| Area             | Best Practice                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prompt Hygiene    | Avoid vague tasks; structure prompts with clear instructions & format     |
| Output Contracts  | Use JSON schemas or function calling APIs for deterministic outputs       |
| PII Redaction     | Apply input sanitization for personally identifiable information          |
| Guardrails        | Set limits on generation length, topics, escalation conditions            |
| Prompt Tuning     | Maintain version control of system prompts and few-shot examples          |
| Drift Monitoring  | Track confidence scores and fallback patterns over time                   |
| Testing Benchmarks| Validate against labeled test sets for each major intent                  |
| Escalation Logic  | Confidence threshold rules (< 0.6 â†’ AgentTransfer or human handoff)       |
| Logging & Audit   | Log input/output pairs, scores, and route logic for compliance            |

## Architecture Recommendations

- **Use Function Calling:** Combine prompt logic with task-specific APIs to reduce hallucination
- **Streamlit / Power BI Dashboards:** Visualize fallback rates, low-confidence predictions, and intent coverage
- **Microsoft Fabric / Synapse:** Centralize interaction data with secured access for analytics and governance
- **Hybrid Models:** Use smaller deterministic models for high-volume, low-variance tasks (e.g., address capture)
- **Cascading LLMs:** Use fast, cost-efficient classifiers to triage before full LLM engagement

## Evaluation Framework

| Metric                | Target     |
|------------------------|------------|
| Intent Accuracy        | >92%       |
| Fallback Rate          | <8%        |
| Confidence Clarity     | Score with histogram distribution logs |
| JSON Compliance Rate   | >95% valid structure |
| Time to Route Decision | <300ms     |
| Prompt Drift Events    | 0 per release cycle |

## Continuous Improvement Loop

- Weekly retraining queue based on fallback logs
- Monthly model performance audit via annotated samples
- Quarterly governance review using `ai-raci-matrix-template.xlsx`
