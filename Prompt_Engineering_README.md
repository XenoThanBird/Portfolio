# Prompt Engineering & GPT Fine-Tuning

This module showcases prompt architectures, templates, and tuning strategies I’ve developed for enterprise-class bots using GPT-4o, Kore.ai, and multi-modal routing workflows in telecom environments.

## Key Components

- ** Billing Router Prompts**  
  GPT-4o system prompts tailored for zero-shot classification and function calling across Cable & Mobile billing bots.

- ** Multimodal Routing Prompts**  
  Designed for IVR + chat + image input using GPT-4o’s multi-input capability.

- ** Zero-Shot Kore.ai Prompt Strategy**  
  Full prompt set for intent detection and disambiguation with structured JSON output.

- ** Templates**  
  Reusable scaffolds for building prompt-based bots across any domain.

- ** Cheat Sheet**  
  Fast reference guide on role prompting, structure, and response evaluation.

## How to Use

1. Copy a prompt file as your system message or Few-Shot format.
2. Customize for your enterprise bot (e.g., billing, repair, account).
3. Use output format examples for LLM scoring, fallback triggers, or Kore.ai training import.

## Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping of new intents
- LLM-driven IVR routing
- Hybrid rule-based + generative bot workflows
- Telecom call triage and escalation mapping
