# Responsible LLM Deployment Guidelines

These guidelines provide a practical framework for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in enterprise environments while ensuring fairness, accountability, security, and explainability.

## Guiding Principles

| Principle     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transparency  | Clearly inform users when they are interacting with an AI system            |
| Fairness      | Evaluate and mitigate bias across training data and output                  |
| Accountability| Assign ownership for each model’s lifecycle                                 |
| Privacy       | Prevent unintended exposure of personally identifiable information (PII)    |
| Explainability| Ensure outputs are interpretable or paired with rationale or disclaimers    |
| Reliability   | Monitor performance, drift, and system availability over time               |

## Data Privacy & PII Handling

- Apply **PII redaction** before training, fine-tuning, or prompt injection
- Don’t log inputs/outputs with sensitive data unless encryption and access control are in place
- Use differential privacy techniques when analyzing sensitive cohorts

---

## Fairness & Bias Mitigation

- Perform **demographic parity** tests on representative inputs
- Use **counterfactual testing** (e.g., change race/gender values) to identify bias
- Maintain audit logs for flagged interactions and user complaints

---

## Prompt Safety & Alignment

- Use guardrails in prompt structure to prevent harmful responses
- Define tone, persona, and limits clearly in system prompts
- For function-calling prompts, require parameter validation on return

## Testing Before Deployment

| Category         | Test Example                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Functional        | Does it return correct API call with parameters? |
| Accuracy          | Is the classification or routing correct?       |
| Red Team Testing  | Can it be provoked into harmful/off-topic output?|
| Drift Monitoring  | Are results consistent across time/user types?  |

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

- Real-time logging of user input, LLM output, confidence, and route
- Feedback loop from fallback triggers to prompt tuning queue
- Establish **intervention thresholds** (e.g., <0.60 confidence → human review)

---

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] System prompt and Few-Shot examples documented
- [ ] JSON output schema with explanation
- [ ] Test set with labels and accuracy benchmarks
- [ ] Escalation procedures and contact owners
- [ ] Responsible Use Policy acknowledged by users/admins

## Tools for Governance

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Microsoft Fabric LLM Logs | Query and trace decisions over time |
| Kore.ai Fallback Tracker | Capture misunderstood intent patterns |
| Power BI | Visualize performance KPIs & drift |
| GPT-Based Evaluators | Grade LLM output correctness, safety, tone |
