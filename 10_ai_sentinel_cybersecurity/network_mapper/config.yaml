# Network Inventory & Audit — Configuration
# Discover devices and identify exposed ports on authorized networks.

# IMPORTANT: Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to scan.
# Unauthorized scanning may violate laws and regulations.

# Target configuration
target:
  # Default: localhost only (safe for demos)
  subnet: "127.0.0.1"
  # For real network scans, use CIDR notation: "192.168.1.0/24"

# Port scanning
ports:
  # Common service ports to scan
  range: "22,23,25,53,80,110,143,443,445,993,995,3306,3389,5432,8080,8443"
  # Scan timeout per port (seconds)
  timeout: 2
  # Maximum concurrent scans
  max_concurrent: 50

# Device fingerprinting
fingerprint:
  # Enable MAC vendor lookup
  mac_lookup: true
  # Enable OS fingerprinting via TTL/window size
  os_fingerprint: true

# Risk assessment
risk_flags:
  # Ports that indicate elevated risk when open
