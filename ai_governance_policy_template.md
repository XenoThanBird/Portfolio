## Responsible AI Focus Areas

- **Transparency:** Disclose AI participation to users.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Test for fairness, especially on customer-facing bots.
- **Accountability:** Assign model owners and escalation pathways.
- **Security:** Redact PII and log decisions.
- **Explainability:** JSON output schemas and decision rationale.

## How to Use This

1. Customize the governance policy for your org’s risk tolerance.
2. Complete and circulate the RACI matrix for all active LLM workflows.
3. Adopt the prompt safety and testing best practices during model design.
4. Deploy monitoring dashboards to track drift, fallback, and escalation.
5. Revisit governance quarterly — or when deploying a new AI capability.
