# Automation Opportunity Scoring Framework

This document provides a structured model for evaluating and prioritizing automation or passive income projects based on effort, scalability, time ROI, and alignment with long-term financial goals.

---

## Evaluation Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Strategic Fit | How well does this align with long-term wealth-building or AI goals? |
| Time ROI | How much passive income or time savings per hour of setup? |
| Scalability | Can this scale to generate revenue without linear effort? |
| Setup Complexity | How technically difficult is initial deployment? |
| Cost to Build | Initial or recurring investment needed? |
| Market Demand | Are people actively seeking or willing to pay for this? |

---

## Scoring System

Use a 1–5 scale for each category (5 = best outcome).

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5     | Excellent, low-friction + high-reward |
| 4     | Very good |
| 3     | Moderate opportunity |
| 2     | Low ROI or too time intensive |
| 1     | Poor fit or unsustainable |

## Deployment Roadmap

1. **Ideate:** Generate 10–20 project concepts
2. **Score:** Evaluate each with the matrix above
3. **Filter:** Pick top 3 by weighted score or alignment
4. **Build:** Commit to 2-week sprints per project
5. **Automate:** Add dashboards, alerts, or self-updating workflows
6. **Monitor:** Track performance monthly and kill/scale accordingly

## Tools for Automation

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Zapier / Make | No-code multi-app workflows |
| Streamlit / Dash | Analytics or tool frontends |
| GPT-4o / OpenAI API | Content, routing, analysis |
| GitHub Actions | Scheduled tasks, deployment |
| CCXT | Crypto market signals + trading APIs |
| Notion / Google Sheets | KPI and financial tracking |

## Tips for Success

- Think *product*, not *project*
- Keep MVPs lean and functional — polish later
- Log time spent so ROI is measurable
- Aim for income sources that work while you sleep
